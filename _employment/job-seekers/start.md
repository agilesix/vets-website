You and your spouse have access to resources through VA and other federal entities that can assist you in making a new or existing business a success.

If you are already open for business and want to sell to the Federal government, contact your closest Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for assistance with all of the required documentation and registration to bid on Government contracts.  Please refer to the [PTAC Website](http://www.aptac-us.org/) for the listing of an office near you.

If you need assistance in starting a business, please visit the [Small Business Development Center (SBDC)](https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/osbdc/resources/11409) Website and contact your closest Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) for assistance.

If you are Service-Disabled Veteran who wants to start a business, please view the [Veterans Business Outreach Program](https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/sba-locations/headquarters-offices) website and the [SBDC](https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/osbdc/resources/11409) website for assistance.

VA can help you [register your business](link to register page) as a Veteran-owned or service-disabled Veteran-owned business. Once you receive your certification, you are eligible for certain assistance and benefits.

The Small Business Administration also has [resources specifically for Veterans](https://www.sba.gov/content/veteran-service-disabled-veteran-owned). 

### Learn more
Many universities and nonprofit organizations offer free or low-cost entrepreneur and business-focused courses, some held online and others in person, for Veterans and military family members.
