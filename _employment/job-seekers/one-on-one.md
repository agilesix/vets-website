One-on-one assistance can help you transition by providing current perspectives on workplaces, targeted job-search techniques, coaching, and résumé building. There are many government and private resources available to you as you make this transition, including:

- [Transition Assistnace Program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/tap/) (TAP)
- VA's [Education and Career Counseling](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/edu_voc_counseling.asp) program
- The Veterans Employment Services Office [VESO](http://vaforvets.va.gov/)

### Are you eligible for personalized career guidance?
Yes, if:

- You are a Veteran.
- You are a Guard or Reserve member demobilizing after 180 days or more of active service.

### Who is covered 
- You 
- Your spouse (only for the Career Technical Training Track)

### How it works
Transitioning Servicemembers are required to attend the Transition Assistance Program (TAP)) briefings. These include: 

- Preseparation counseling, in which your skills, interests, and goals are evaluated and integrated into a custom roadmap. 
- Résumé-building assistance and interview training.
- Three optional additional workshops: Career Technical Training Track, Education Track, and Entrepreneurship Track.
- Information on all available VA benefits (contact VA career and training specialists at 1-800-827-1000).

1.	Log in to your [eBenefits account](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov).
2.	Select Apply.
3.	Select Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits.
4.	Apply for Education and Career Counseling. Eligible Veterans will receive an invitation to a session at a regional VA office.
